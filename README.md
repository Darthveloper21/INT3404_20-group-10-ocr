# INT3404_20-group-10-ocr
Mid term project

Original paper: [link](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/mm-27.pdf)

In this project, we replicate the experiment in the given paper, which is extracting the position of the word in a handwritten document by using scale space technique. We can not find any source code that relevant to the original project so we had to write our own program based on the described algorithm and formulas.

# Running replicate experiment

## Prerequisite

  - python (we recommend using version 3.6 or above) </br>
  - opencv-python </br>
  - numpy </br>
  - scipy

## Run code

This is just an experiment so to change the input image it is required to do it manually:
  - Go to main.py file
  - Change the 20th line into file path of a .png image
  - Run main.py
  - Go to output folder to see the result
